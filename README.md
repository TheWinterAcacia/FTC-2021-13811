# FTC-Robot-2019
This Github repository is for storing code used for our robot in the 2019 FTC Skystone competition. The competition is now over, so it is being used for whoever is brave enough to want to look/copy from it.

Our gamepadTank.java is for our driver controls, and our autonomous.java is for the autonomous phase of the competition.
The autonomous[Depot/Stack][Red/Blue][Bridge/Wall].java(s) are when we place our robot on their respective stacking and depot sides. Since our robot can handle more extensive movements due to a set of dead reckoning encoder wheels and the use of an IMU we will park on the near side of the line.

There are a couple terrible test autonomouses and gamepads and we're leaving there for documentation purposes.
