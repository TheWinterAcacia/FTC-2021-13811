# FTC-Robot-2019
This Github repo is for storing code used for our robot in the 2019 FTC Skystone competition.

Our gamepad.java is for our driver controls, and our autonomous.java is for the autonomous phase of the competition.
The autonomous[Red/Blue][Tray/Push].java(s) are when we place our robot on the red or blue alliance sides and their respective tray and push sides. Since our robot can handle more extensive movements due to a (currently not installed) set of dead reckoning encoder wheels and the use of a gyro sensor we will park on the near side of the line.
