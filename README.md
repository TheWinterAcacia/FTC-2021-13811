# FTC-Robot-2019
This Github repo is for storing code used for our robot in the 2019 FTC Skystone competition.

Our gamepad.java is for our driver controls, and our autonomous.java is for the autonomous phase of the competition.
The autonomous[Red/Blue][Tray/Push].java(s) are when we place our robot on their respective tray and push sides. Since our robot can handle more extensive movements due to a set of dead reckoning encoder wheels and the use of a (currently not installed) gyro sensor and IMU we will park on the near side of the line.

There are a couple test autonomouses and gamepads and for testing purposes, we're leaving it there for documentation purposes.
